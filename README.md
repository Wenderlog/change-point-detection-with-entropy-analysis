# Entropy-based Change Point Detection

Experiments on tuning hyperparameters of entropy-based methods (Approximate, Sample, Bubble, Permutation, Slope, Dispersion) for change point detection.  
The project includes validation on synthetic datasets (ECG, Finance) and application to the real-world dataset **Coal Mining Disasters** (annual records of mining accidents with fatalities).  

## Features
- Implementation of entropy-based change point detection methods  
- Manual hyperparameter tuning and calibration  
- Synthetic experiments for debugging and benchmarking  
- Real data experiment on Coal Mining Disasters  
- Comparison with Bayesian CPD results from previous research

## Requirements
- Python 3.13  
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
